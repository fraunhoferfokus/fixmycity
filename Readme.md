[FixMyCity](http://www.fixmycity.de)
===================================

This is the core project of the FixMyCity Platform. It consists of the following components:

* Backend including Server, REST APIs, Database, etc.
* Admin Console (same as you can see here https://fixmycity.sonsofpiracy.org/admin/)
* Mobile Web App (same as you can see here https://fixmycity.sonsofpiracy.org/fmc-mob/)
	* Please note that the Mobile Web App is also available as Cordova (https://cordova.apache.org/) Application for Android, iOS and Windows Phone. Most of the code of the Mobile Web App is reused in the Cordova App. The Cordova App loads its UI from the backend. The Cordova App and the Mobile Web App provide the same features. The only difference is that the Cordova App can be deployed to the App Store, Play Store, etc. and installed as native App on Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The Access to the camera to take picture is handled in a different way as in the Mobile Web App.

	> Cordova projects for all other platforms will be published soon

**Fixmycity**:

   >  (django)$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

 * To use the static files with the testserver, you have to set the Debug variable to "true" in settings.py.
   * It is not recommended to use *debug = true* in production.
   * In production mode you need to host the static files through another server e.g. Apache. Please refer to the [Django 1.3.3 Documentation, section 4.16](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/django/1.3.X/django.pdf) for more details.

 * Run the testserver  
   >  (django)$ sudo python manage.py runserver 8080  
 * the number is the port and can be freely chosen.
